## Overview
This openmc project consists of three main scripts: one that defines materials, geometry, and settings (PWR_pincell_burnup.py), 
one that is used to cstore constants that can then be accessed from both other scripts (config.py), 
and one that takes care of the post-processing and data-visualization (post-processing.py).

## Results
The resulting data visualizations include an atom-fraction vs burnup plot for various instrumental isotopes,
k-effective vs burnup and k-effective vs time plots, a decay heat vs burnup plot, and finally an activity vs burnup plot.

## What Next?
I'm not sure I'll do too much more with this project in the future, but I will definitely be implementing the structural, organizational, 
and depletion modeling skills I learned through the creation of the project in future ones down the line.
